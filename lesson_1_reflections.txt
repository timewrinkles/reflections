1.  Using the FC command helps to narrow down
locations where code has changed from one build to another and therefore the locations where a problem could be introduced.  This saves time and mental work in scrolling and guessing at possible culprits.

2.  You can assess changes as you make them and maintain and record of what has worked and in which combinations.

3.  Manually controlling commits can help to reduce clutter and useless saves.  Automatic might be helpful for especially forgetful people.

6.  With version control you retain the previous versions of your program so that you can return to them if an error is introduced.
